# Udacity_EDA_with_R

This project is related to Data Analyst Nanodegree Program in Udacity
In this project, I will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### Why this Project? 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied.

EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover to other questions, and eventually predictive models. It also is an important “line of defense” against bad data and is an opportunity to notice that your assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.
